        <p>
          Enjoying yearly programming puzzles at <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> since 2015!
          Since 2018, a community-run (unofficial) survey has been held.
          The data is available under the ODbL license <a href="https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/advent-of-code-surveys">on GitHub</a>.
          Here we present summarized results since 2021.

          <p id="languageDescription" class="chart-description">
            Bar chart showing Python 3 at a whopping (steady over the years) 40ish percent.
            Rust is a clear second and another year on the rise up to 16%.
            In third place is JavaScript for many consecutive years, followed closely (in order) by C++, C#, Java, and Go (all roughly 5-8%).
            Python 2 is is nearly gone in 2022.
            Finally, a whopping roughly 20% had "Other" languages than the top 15 options!
            For full details on this graph and others, you can toggle a data table (warning: that really gives you <em>all</em> the data!).

            Bar chart showing VS Code in top spot, climbing a bit more to a staggering 45%!
            Neovim doubled from last year on to a near 7% share!
            Vim declined in a roughly equal percentage (but is still in 3rd place).
            It is preceded by IntelliJ in 2nd spot at 10%, and followed by (in order) PyCharm, Neovim, Visual Studio, Emacs, and others.
            Finally, roughly 15% of users each year said they use some "Other" IDE not listed in the top.

            The Bar Chart shows the three main Operating Systems as the three top options.
            Windows in first (42% in 2022), Linux next (31% in 2022), and macOS third (25% in 2022).
            WSL is a "fourth" option at a little under 1%, and a little over 1% of people responded with custom options.

            Bar Chart showing people chose three main options as a reason for participating.
            In order (roughly the same for all years) are "For Fun" (96% in 2022), "For a challenge" (84% in 2022), and "Improve Skills" (76% in 2022).
            After ther decent chunks of people selected other default answers, and a bunch of people gave custom remarks: toggle the data table below for full details!

            Bar chart shows a clear change from 2018 when the first survey was held.
            Especially the change from 29% (2018) to 43% (2022) of people answering they're "Not interested" in going for the leaderboard.
            Interestingly, less people directly attribute this to "Timezone is problematic" (down to 22% in 2022 from 32% in 2018).
            Again a couple percent of respondents gave custom reasons, toggle the data table for all insights.

            Same as previous years, about 70% of all people are in either 0 or 1 private leaderboards, split 50/50.
            After that, it declines, but even then, roughly 4% have 4 or even 5+ private leaderboards they participate in.

            This stacked bar chart clearly shows that (logically) this survey is biased towards people who participate in 2022 in December itself.
            Every year before that, the number of people who said they participated roughly halves (and "Did it after December of that year" is a lot smaller than "In December").

          <p id="responsesPerDayDescription" class="chart-description">
            This very straightforward line chart shows that all 4 survey years 2021 and before followed the same pattern: a huge bump after the survey announement, and a small boost around December 15th following the reminder.
            In 2022 there are three bumps (and three announcements), and the line ends up a couple hundred responses below 2021.

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Look, I'll be honest: this survey was a spur of the moment thing that got out of hand.
        I do my utmost best to get decent data without too much bias and other typical problems.
        But it's a spare time effort, and I'm not a professional empirical evidence researcher by any stretch.
        Take the results with a grain of salt, speculate, enjoy the results, but don't draw important conclusions from it!
      </p>
      <p>
        The survey has remained largely the same over the years, allowing for nice comparisons between the years.
        Almost all visuals above show "percentage of responses within that year".
        So "43.2% Python 3" means that out of all responses <em>for that year</em>, 43.2% indicated they used Python 3.
        This is better than absolutes, because the number of responses vary between years.
      </p>
      <h3>Bias</h3>
      <p>
        Take special care about the fact that there's <em>heavy</em> bias in the cohort surveyed.
        Most people came to the survey from either Reddit or Twitter, and this will skew the data accordingly.
        The more we can spread the word to a more representative AoC-user-base in the future years, the more interesting and correct the data becomes.
        But for now, <strong>remember that the results are about people that tend to see the survey around</strong>, not about "all AoC participants".
      </p>
      <h3>Bottom line</h3>
      <p>
        In short: enjoy these results!
        Responsibly, please.
