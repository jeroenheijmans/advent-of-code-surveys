# Redaction

Each year the Survey starts with a disclaimer similar to this, extra emphasis added here:

> This is a quick (unofficial / not affiliated with) Advent of Code 2024 **anonymous (if you don't disclose your identity in "Other..." answers) participant survey**.
> Note that your data will be shared as part of a (**possibly sanitized and trimmed**) data set to be published under the Open Database License 1.0 (https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0).

In short: I _moderate_ the raw results before the end up in the repository, ensuring mostly anonymous and sanitized results.
Here are some of the reasons answers may get redacted, removed, or changed slightly:

- **Prevent accidental disclosure of personally identifiable information.**
  For example e-mail addresses can be a cause for answers being trimmed or redacted.
  Potential personably identifiable information (including information related to race, gender, religion, etc.) is also redacted by default.
  This is a balance between having cool statistics about our community, and keeping all survey participants and their data safe and as anonymous as they might desire or expect.
  We try to err on the side of safety here, so unless the answer was clearly intended to be shared publicly (e.g. someone naming their homebrew programming language for the "What language do you use?" question) things might get redacted even when the answerer wanted to actually *share* that bit of information.

- **Keep the "Other..." answers civil, PG-rated, and professional.**
  Essentially we're following [the official /r/adventofcode Community Code of Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/rules/conduct/).
  In (very) short: follow netiquette, be nice to each other, keep things PG-rated and professional (including avoidance of overly aggressive use of curse words).
  We try to err on the side of safety here as well.

- **For sanitization purposes.**
  Some "Other..." answers are similar enough to me as a moderator, that they should be grouped.
  The change can be small (like grouping while disregarding interpunction), or a little bigger (like synonyms, or phrasings that might mean the same).
  These sanitization steps might be improved year over year to get a clearer end result.
  Just about all of the sanitization rules can be seen in the code of this repository.
