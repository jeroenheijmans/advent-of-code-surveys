TypeScript is just behind JavaScript. A whopping 22.7% of "Other..." answers. Python 2 is shown in the graph at a tiny %, only because the earliest survey years gave it a much larger percentage.

When enabling older years, especially 2018, a stark change is seen, amongst which the demise of "Atom". And, 18.4% of "Other..." IDE's were used.

            Bar chart showing a clear trend over the years: <strong>more respondents are "not interested" in global leaderboard participation</strong>, but less people seem to attribute this to the timezone being problematic. As might be expected (and can be seen in the full data table), in 2024 many "Other..." answers quote the rise of AI tools as a reason for not participating in the Global Leaderboard.

            This stacked bar chart clearly shows that (logically) this survey is biased towards people who participate in 2024 in December itself. This year each question had a link to your stars for that year, so data might be a little more accurate. It's fun to see that more folks went back to do 2015 than 2016 and 2017: "you've gotta start at the beginning"?

            Line chart with 2024 highlighted, showing the number of survey responses per day (cumulative). The huge boost around December 14 can probably be attributed to the boosts on Social Media from Eric Wastl, who has a rather large reach (cheers! :D). And: thank you to everyone filling out the survey, you're the best!!

            Bar chart showing feelings survey respondents felt aligned with. About 62% of y'all indicate not using AI at all. The tongue-in-cheek option "<em>Ugh, not again with the AI</em>" attracted a whopping 41% of y'all. Almost 10% of you "<em>Will submit to our new AI Overlords</em>". On the more serious end the subject is polarizing, but still weighing a tad towards "it's bad for AoC". <strong>Toggle the data table to be amazed</strong> at the hundreds of custom responses folks gave!

            Bar chart showing sentiments towards AI, quite similar to results from 2023. (Because of personal circumstances and time constraints, the 2024-specific question ended up being the same as 2023.)<br><br>
            ⚠️ Just like the Advent of Code organizers, I was unprepared for how (much) AI would be involved this year, or how vocal some folks would get in their discourse and the "Other..." answers. Moderating the "Other..." answers a bit to keep things civil will require quite a bit of time, so the initial 2024-results will release without detailed "Other..." options. Hope y'all understand!

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Look, I'll be honest: this survey was a spur of the moment thing that got out of hand.
        I do my utmost best to get decent data without too much bias and other typical problems.
        But it's a spare time effort, and I'm not a professional empirical evidence researcher by any stretch.
        Take the results with a grain of salt, speculate, enjoy the results, but don't draw important conclusions from it!
      </p>
      <p>
        The survey has remained largely the same over the years, allowing for nice comparisons between the years.
        Almost all visuals above show "percentage of responses within that year".
        So "43.2% Python 3" means that out of all responses <em>for that year</em>, 43.2% indicated they used Python 3.
        This is better than absolutes, because the number of responses vary between years.
      </p>
      <h3>Bias</h3>
      <p>
        Take special care about the fact that there's <em>heavy</em> bias in the cohort surveyed.
        Most people came to the survey from either Reddit or Twitter, and this will skew the data accordingly.
        The more we can spread the word to a more representative AoC-user-base in the future years, the more interesting and correct the data becomes.
        But for now, <strong>remember that the results are about people that tend to see the survey around</strong>, not about "all AoC participants".
      </p>
      <h3>Bottom line</h3>
      <p>
        In short: enjoy these results!
        Responsibly, please.
        💚
